# Three in One

## Cracking the Coding Interview

<br />

## Question

Write an class that mimics three stacks. You can only use a single array as the underlying data structure.

```
Example
a = ThreeStack()
a.push(0, 4) # stack 0, push 4
a.push(1, 5) # stack 1, push 4
a.push(2, 7) # stack 2, push 5
a.push(0, 6) # stack 0, push 6
print(a.pop(0)) # 6
print(a.pop(1)) # 5
print(a.pop(2)) # 7
```

We need to modify the original linked list and delete the node that the pointer is pointing at. We can't delete the node because we don't have a pointer to the previous node (check hint). Therefore, we can mimic a deletion by copying over the value from the next node into the node we want to delete. Then, we can just delete the next node in the standard fashion.

```python
class ThreeStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = [None for _ in range(30)]
        self.insert = [0, 10, 20]

    def


```

The time complexity is $$O(1)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
