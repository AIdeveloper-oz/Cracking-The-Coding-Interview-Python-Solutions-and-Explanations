## Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 1.3

## Question

You are given a string with spaces. You want to replace each space with `%20`. The string will have sufficient trailing spaces at the end to contain the additional characters from the `%20`s. You'll also be given an integer that represents the length of the string without the trailing spaces.

Strings are immutable in Python, so you'll get a character array instead (list of chars).

```
Input - ['h', 'i', ' ', 'b', 'u', 'd', ' ', ' '], 7
Output - ['h', 'i', '%', '2', '0', 'b', 'u', 'd']
```

You can solve this using the two pointer technique. One pointer (`p1`) is at the end of the array. The other pointer (`p2`) is at the end of the "true" string (it's initialized to the integer we get as input).

1. Initiate a while loop that iterates while `p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0`.
   - If the character at `p2` is not equal to " ", then copy the character at `p2` over to `p1`. Decrement both pointers.
   - If the character at `p2` is equal to " ", then copy over each char in `02%` to `p1` and decrement `p1` as you go. Remember that we're iterating backwards, which is why we use `02%` instead of `%20`. Then, decrement both pointers
2. Exit the function

```python
def urlify(s, i):
    p1, p2 = len(s) - 1, i
    while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
        if s[p2] != " ":
            s[p1] = s[p2]
        else:
            for i in reversed("%20"):
                s[p1] = i
                p1 -= 1
        p1 -= 1
        p2 -= 1
```

The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
